# MoneFi

MoneFi is a non-profit FINTECH company connecting small business owners to financial partners, and
educational services; regardless of credit score.

Things I did:

1. Developed and implemented borrower debt form using Formik and validation using Yup, resulting in
improved efficiency and accuracy in the data collection process.

2. Designed and created the borrower debt and notes database and connected them to the controllers and interfaces,
implementing stored procedures and improving data retrieval and storage capabilities.

3. Adapted a notes component to connect to new and current lectures for UI.

4. Implemented notes database schema design and data modeling.
